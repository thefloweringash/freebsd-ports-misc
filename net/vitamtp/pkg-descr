libVitaMTP is a library based off of libMTP that does low level USB
communications with the Vita. It can read and receive MTP commands
that the Vita sends, which are a proprietary set of commands that
is based on the MTP open standard.

OpenCMA is a frontend that allows the user to transfer games, saves,
and media to and from the PlayStation Vita. It makes use of libVitaMTP
to communicate with the device and other libraries to interpret the
data sent and received. OpenCMA is a command line tool that aims
to be an open source replacement to Sony's official Content Management
Assistant.
