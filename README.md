These ports are here because they haven't been accepted (or in some
cases submitted) upstream, but published in the hope they will be
useful or provide a starting point for a proper port.

Some ports here have known issues. You should read through the port to
make sure it matches your expectations and proceed at your own risk.

The layout of this repository is compatible with [portshaker][].
